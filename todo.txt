- an ascii art based image editor would be really nice - I end up drawing things that use a grid pretty regularly, so the fact that i have the ability to do non gridded things isn't critical... also drawings are incredibly slow in the current version.
- add api docs for the following
    - text actor
    - particle actor (fix defaults)
    - sound (its really rough right now, maybe fix this)
    - random
    - number extensions
- display extension / overrides exist, maybe write a simple one?
- better letterboxing on mobile
- sound on mobile
- mute button in the html (store mute state too)
- make the gif capture support frame dropping
- save name in the config should use the game name if missing
- pause game when focus is lost on the page
- rewrite the public api of the sound to be more sensible
- on touch, switch to the last touch down when a touch is removed
