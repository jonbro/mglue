- move all the server / script stuff into the main repo
    - it seems like you can provide for doing stuff like `npm run mglue server` with https://docs.npmjs.com/files/package.json#bin
    and https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/run-script
    - react has this create system `npx create-react-app my-app` which probably works with yeoman as well
    - see if I can lower the number of dependencies in mglue dependent projects -- make a simple template
- better letterboxing on mobile
- sound on mobile
- mute button in the html (store mute state too)
- make the gif capture support frame dropping
- save name in the config should use the game name if missing
- pause game when focus is lost on the page
- rewrite the public api of the sound to be more sensible
- on touch, switch to the last touch down when a touch is removed
